# Who am I?

I‚Äôm a full stack web developer with a background in professional gaming, community management, teaching, and entrepreneurship.

## What are my technical skills?

My technical skills include Ruby, Sinatra, Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, React.js, Redux, and GraphQL.

## What's my background?

üßê - Full Stack Web Development - Went through Flatiron School‚Äôs coding bootcamp and learned HTML & CSS, Ruby, Sinatra, Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, React.js, and Redux. Built projects showcasing each of these skills, including a full stack web application with a Rails API backend and a React frontend.

üéÆ - Professional Gaming & Community Management - Built an audience of over 16,000 followers as a partnered Twitch broadcaster during a challenge to stream for over 300 consecutive days. Transitioned to a behind-the-scenes role as community manager for Muthead.com, where my projects included launching and hosting a Madden podcast and growing it to over 8,000 weekly downloads, building up an informative YouTube channel, and helping to organize and run sponsored Madden tournaments for professional players.

üìà - Entrepreneurship and Growth - Launched smartmadden.com (later acquired by PlaybookGG), a Madden tips website built on Wordpress. Building this site and growing the customer base came with all sorts of new and interesting challenges, ranging from simple things like how to tweak the site‚Äôs design to more challenging things like how to consistently attract new customers and make growth and retention more systematic.
